# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method? **I am pretty confident.**
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle? **I would definitely say i had a productive struggle**
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? **I just need more practice putting everything we've learned so far together**
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? **No further questions.**
